## PolarCL User Manual

... for now, there's only a collection of random remarks


#### Configuration and startup

```
load-configuration
```

#### Notes

* HTTP header names are stored as lowercase keywords. Example: :|transfer-encoding|

* In the response, use case-sensitive keywords for setting headers, for example :|Content-Type|


#### ToDo

* Decide: Load stuff from its default location OR load stuff relative to PolarCL?
* Make caching available for loading files from dynamic handlers
